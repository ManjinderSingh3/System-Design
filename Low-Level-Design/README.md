# Low Level Design

## Building Blocks of Low Level Design

### 1. OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Concepts
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### 2. Design Principles
- SOLID Principles


Principles for Code Quality and Clean Architecture 
- DRY Principle
- YAGNI Principle
- KISS Principle


### 3. Design Patterns

| Creational Patterns   | Structural Patterns | Behavioral Patterns         |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Singleton             | Adapter             | Iterator                    |
| Factory Method        | Bridge              | Observer                    |
| Abstract Factory      | Composite           | Strategy                    |
| Builder               | Decorator           | Command                     |
| Prototype             | Facade              | State                       |
|                       | Flyweight           | Template Method             |
|                       | Proxy               | Visitor                     |
|                       |                     | Mediator                    |
|                       |                     | Memento                     |
|                       |                     | Chain of Responsibility     |


### 4. UML Diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are used to visually represent systems. They are broadly divided into two categories :

Structural UML Diagrams
- Class Diagram

Behavioral UML Diagrams
- Use Case Diagram
- Activity Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- State Machine Diagram
